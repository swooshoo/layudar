### Motive:

With recent current events of the Palisades and Eaton fires, open-source and free services such as watchduty.org  have been incredibly heelpful towards the cause and keeping locals informed. One feature that is lacking is a centralized website where people who want to donate can refer to. With emergency efforts probably lasting well over a month, a resource as such could help streamline and carry some weight in these volunteer efforts.
