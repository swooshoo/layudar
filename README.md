### Motive:

With recent current events of the Palisades and Eaton fires, open-source and free services such as watchduty.org  have been incredibly heelpful towards the cause and keeping locals informed. One feature that is lacking is a centralized website where people who want to donate can refer to. With emergency efforts probably lasting well over a month, a resource as such could help streamline and carry some weight in these volunteer efforts. 


### Project Proposal:

The current project roadmap is to implement a collaborative Google Sheets for each shelter to enter their physical inventory of supplies  into. On our end, we will process and automate the data to display it onto a shelter's "shelter page" on a website that updates as often as we can (ideally at the end of a day). Users can refer to local shelter pages that visualizes how much of each supply they have. 

Shelter pages will have easy-to-read graphs and visuals (i.e. pie charts) to show their inventory and what they might be lacking in. For instance, a donator might see a shelter with a total 90% of their inventory being water bottles and cans, and decide that they can contribute to the 2% inventory of feminine products.

Scaling this project to an extensive means will rely on shelter-to-shelter communication sharing the Google Form so we can best support them.
