        We saw a need to centralize all of the legitimate and local resources out there for emergency relief, volunteer opportunities, and etc.
        
        Streamlining disaster relief efforts, **LAyudar** connects communities with local shelters, donation centers, and food banks in need. 
        By gathering real-time inventory updates through daily Google Form submissions, we ensure accurate and centralized information for donors and volunteers.
        Together, we make it easier to support emergency response and recovery.
