        We saw a need to centralize all of the legitimate and local resources out there for emergency relief, volunteer opportunities, and etc.
        
        Streamlining disaster relief efforts, **LAyudar** connects communities with local shelters, donation centers, and food banks in need. 
        By gathering real-time inventory updates through daily Google Form submissions, we ensure accurate and centralized information for donors and volunteers.
        Together, we make it easier to support emergency response and recovery. 
        
        Our name comes from a play on words from combining **Los Angeles** and the word **"ayudar"**, which means "to help" in Spanish.
